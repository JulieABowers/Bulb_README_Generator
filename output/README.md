# README Generator

[![License: GNU GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)]

## Description

My motivation was to create a README generator that would speed up the creation of the file. It would add appropriate headers and links as necessary. It does not, however, fix my spelling and typing skill.
